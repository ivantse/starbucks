Starbucks
by Ivan Tse


USAGE: ORDER <PLATFORM> <PROJECT|LIST>
======


   Examples:

     c:\starbucks> order j2me wall           <-- will d/l Wall and toolkit3_release

     c:\starbucks> order j2me list           <-- show list of all available j2me projects



Configuration
=============
  In the config/ directory, there are the brew_repositories.xml and the
j2me_repositories.xml files. These should be fairly self-explanatory...
If there are any projects missing, please feel free to add them and commit
them so everyone can share in the knowledge!

Thanks!
