How to compile with setup.py
============================

Generally, you can just run make_exe.bat and it will compile the executable(s)
into the dist/ directory.

However, for this to work, you'll need certain libraries/bindings for your
installation of Python.


Requirements:
=============
  - Python 2.5 (maybe earlier version like 2.4 may work, but untested)
  - pySVN bindings
  - py2exe bindings
