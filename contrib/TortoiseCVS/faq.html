<h2><a name="whatistortoisecvs">What is TortoiseCVS?</a></h2>
<p>
<p>TortoiseCVS lets you work with files under <a
href="http://www.cvshome.org">CVS</a> version control directly from
Windows Explorer.  It is freely available under the GPL open source
license.  Most of this FAQ answers technical questions about
problems with the software, or about how to use it.  For more
general information and screen shots, go to <a
href="http://www.tortoisecvs.org">tortoisecvs.org</a>.

<h2><a name="love">I love TortoiseCVS, how do I give some money towards it?</a></h2>
<p>Thank you for offering!  You've got three choices:
<ul>
	<li>If you want to give a substantial amount of money, and there is
	a particular improvement to TortoiseCVS that you would like, you can
	try to find someone to pay to make that improvement.
	Send a mail to the <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/tortoisecvs-users">mailing list</a>
	with your request.
	</li>
	<li>If you would like to help promote TortoiseCVS then we are
	happy to take donations to advertise on Google, or any other
	suggestions that you have.
	</li>
	<li>You can show your appreciation by giving money to Francis's (the creator of TortoiseCVS)
	favourite charity, <a
	href="http://www.oxfam.org/eng/donate.htm">Oxfam</a>.  This
	will make us happy and glowy, retripling our efforts to make
	TortoiseCVS the most enjoyable version control client.
	<p>Oxfam helps people help themselves out of poverty.  There
	are hundreds of millions of people without sufficient food, clean
	water, shelter or security.  Only by them improving their situation can
	we build a completely civilised world, safer for everyone.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="charlie">Who is Charlie?</a></h2>
<p>Charlie is the the lovable TortoiseCVS mascot. His full name is Charlie Vernon Smythe (CVS).</p> 
<p>Charlie isn't very technical (as he is a only a tortoise), so support
questions should be directed to the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=48103">mailing list</a>.

<h2><a name="whynocontextmenuentries">Why are there no context menu entries?</a></h2>
<ul>
<li> If you are using Windows 95 or NT, you have to install the Windows desktop update that 
comes with IE4 or later (see <a href="#windowsdesktopupdate">
How do I install the Windows Desktop Update on NT 4.0 / Win95?</a>).</li>
<li> Is your current directory on a network share or on a removable drive? TortoiseCVS is by default
disabled for those, due to performance reasons. To enable it, go to Preferences -> Policy.</li>
<li> Does the current file / folder have the "system" attribute? TortoiseCVS ignores those 
files. Run "attrib -s &lt;filename&gt;" from the command line to remove the system attribute. </li>
<li>Is your current directory in your Excluded folders list? 
If your Excluded folders list is empty, is your current 
directory in your Included folders list? Try making both 
lists empty (CVS->Preferences->Advanced).</li>

</ul>

<h2><a name="whydonticonsappear">Why don't the icon overlays
appear?</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>If you are using Windows 95 the icon overlays won't work.  You can try the instructions
for Windows NT below if you like, but it may just cause you pain.
<li>On Windows NT, support for icon overlays will be there after having installed
the Windows desktop update that comes with IE4 or later (see <a href="#windowsdesktopupdate">
How do I install the Windows Desktop Update on NT 4.0 / Win95?</a>). 
<p>However, its implementation is fairly buggy, and TortoiseCVS enables overlays only 
for Explorer windows that belong to the first instance of explorer.exe (observe 
the task manager process list to find out when a second instance of
explorer.exe is started).

<p>You may override that behaviour by creating a new DWORD registry value "OverlayIconStatus" under
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\TortoiseCVS and set it to one of the following values:
<ul>
<li>0: Disable icon overlays
<li>1: Enable icon overlays only in the first instance of explorer.exe
<li>2: Enable icon overlays
</ul>
But if you use it to unconditionally enable icon overlays on NT, you'll often
get access violations when closing processes.

<li><p>Still having trouble on NT?  Try running Explorer from a DOS box.
Kill explorer.exe from Task Manager and run a new one by just typing
<tt>explorer</tt> in the DOS box.

<p>Or, try this.  The shortcut labelled Win NT Explorer on your start
menu probably points to <tt>C:\WINNT\explorer.scf</tt> and
<b>doesn't</b> get the overlays.  <p>Create a new shortcut to
<br><tt>%windir%\Explorer.exe /n, /e</tt> <br>and it may get the overlays.

<li>If you're using an IntelliPoint mouse driver, and launching Explorer
via a mouse click, you need to upgrade from version 3 to version 3.2 of
IntelliPoint.  Strangely, launching Explorer from the Start menu gives
icons in this case, but not when launched from the mouse.

</ul>

<h2><a name="whyisiconcachebuggy">Why do the overlay icons sometimes
change to random graphics?</a></h2>
<p>
The Windows icon cache is a fairly
buggy creature.   You can solve this in one of the following ways:

<ul>
<li>Rebuild the icon cache by using the Rebuild Icons command on the CVS submenu.
<li>Or increase the icon cache size. Go to
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer and
add a new String Value called "Max Cached Icons". The default value is 500 -
try increasing it to 2048 (see
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q132/6/68.asp">
http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q132/6/68.asp</a> for more details).
<li>Or delete the file called ShellIconCache in your Windows directory.  And reboot.
</ul>

<h2><a name="problemsonnt4">Why can't I get it to work on NT 4.0?</a></h2>
<p>
Try installing a recent version of MS Internet Explorer (5.5 or higher should work). <br>
<i>Important:</i> Make sure you install the Windows desktop update that comes with Internet Explorer
(see <a href="#windowsdesktopupdate">How do I install the Windows Desktop Update on NT 4.0 / Win95?</a>).



<h2><a name="howchangedefaulticons">Yeuch! Those icons are grotesque, I want better ones!</a></h2>  
<p>
<p>A number of alternative icon sets are available for use with TortoiseCVS. 
You can easily change these icons from the "Preferences Dialog" under the "Main" tab. 
Simply click the "Browse" button to see and select from the wonderful assortment of icon sets.</p>

<h2><a name="win2kservice">On Win2K, I get an error about a missing
entry point in MSVCRT.dll</a></h2> 
<p>You can fix this by upgrading to Windows 2000 service pack 2.

<h2><a name="windowsdesktopupdate">How do I install the Windows Desktop Update on NT 4.0 / Win95?</a></h2> 

<p>To get the Windows desktup update, install IE4, and choose Yes to install the active desktop.
Don't worry, you can turn off the actual active desktop later by right
clicking on it.  It's the new version of Explorer that we are after.

<p>If you've already installed IE5, you must either: <ol> <li>Uninstall
IE5 and then install IE4 with desktop extensions, and then install IE5
again. What a palaver.  <li>Run IE5 setup with command line switches to
install the IE4 desktop (shell) extensions.  This may cause problems, <a
href="http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&safe=off&th=a141d6286e4b302a,4&seekm=OlDwT17y%24GA.280%40cppssbbsa04#p">read
this usenet thread</a> for the source of this information.  <p>The
command must be run from the folder that contains the ie5setup.exe file.
Some users have reported that the browser was initially unstable
afterwards, but was fixed by reinstalling the browser only, others
simply used the IE5 repair procedure.

<p>For Win95: ie5setup.exe /c:"ie5wzd /e:IE4Shell WIN /I:Y"

<p>For WinNT: ie5setup.exe /c:"ie5wzd /e:IE4Shell NTx86 /I:Y" </ol>

<p>For IE6: <ul> <li>Run IE6 setup with command line switches to install
the IE4 desktop (shell) extensions. The same caveats apply as for IE5.
<p>The command must be run from the folder that contains the
ie6setup.exe file.

<p>For WinNT: ie6setup.exe /c:"ie6wzd /e:IE4Shell NTx86 /I:Y" </ul>




<h2><a name="uninstallation">How do I uninstall TortoiseCVS?</a></h2>
<p>Simply uninstall from Add/Remove Programs in the Windows
control panel.</p>
<p>
<h2><a name="ooopsundeletion">Ooops! I accidentally removed a file - how can I get it back?</a></h2>

<p>The removed file has been moved to the Recycle Bin (unless you have turned off the Recycle Bin).</p> 
<p>If you have already committed the removed file, you can simple undo the delete from the 
Recycle Bin, then add the file again. </p>
If you haven't committed the removed file yet, you have two options:
<ul>
<li>Commit the removed file (i.e. commit the directory), rename the backup 
copy and add it again.</li>
<li>Right-click on the removed file in the commit dialog and undo the removal.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h2><a name="commitremove">When I remove a file it vanishes, how do I commit it?</a></h2>
<p>
Easy, you commit the whole directory!  Right click
in the Explorer window next to the file, and choose commit.  It is often easiest to 
always commit things from the top level directory as it is recursive
throughout the whole project.

<h2><a name="undocheckout">How do I discard a change, reverting to the
version in the repository? (Undo Checkout in Sourcesafe)</a></h2>
<p>
Use the Update Special command on the CVS submenu and select the 'Clean
copy' option.  This works on directories as well as individual files.

<p>You can also delete files or folders, and then just use a normal CVS
Update on the folder above to get the latest version out again.

<h2><a name="recommenddiff">Can you recommend an external diff
program?</a></h2>
<p>
The freeware
<a href="http://www.prestosoft.com/ps.asp?page=edp_examdiff">ExamDiff</a> is
brilliant, and works well with TortoiseCVS.  The open source
<a href="http://winmerge.sourceforge.net/">WinMerge</a> is also great, and
at some point we would like to include it with TortoiseCVS.  If you need
different diff programs for different file types (one for text files,
one for binary word processor documents...) you should use <a
href="http://meta-diff.sourceforge.net/">meta-diff</a>.
<p>
<h2><a name="changediff">How do I change the external diff
program?</a></h2>
<p>
Open the Preferences dialog, you can find it on the
start menu.  You can also hold down Control while you click on the CVS
Diff menu option.

<h2><a name="mixandmatch">Can I mix and match with WinCVS or the command
line?</a></h2> 
<p>
Yes, you can check out a module with WinCVS and use it in
TortoiseCVS or vice versa.  If you've installed CVSNT as command line client
you can also mix with that.

<p>Some CVS clients work incorrectly with daylight saving time or time
zones in general under Windows.  You should use
<a href="http://www.cvsnt.org">CVSNT</a> or a sufficiently recent version
of WinCVS with TortoiseCVS version 1.4+, especially on NTFS file
systems.

<h2><a name="sharelinux">Can I share my sandbox with Linux or Cygwin?</a></h2> 
<p>
Unless you know exactly what you're doing, do *not* do that.
It's highly recommended not to access your repository (that was checked out 
with TortoiseCVS, CVSNT or WinCVS) using UNIX-style CVS clients (like Linux's 
or Cygwin's) because of line ending incompatibilities.
See also <a href="#brokenlineendings">here</a>.
</p>

<h2><a name="brokenlineendings">Why do my text files suddenly have an additional 
&lt;CR&gt; at the end of each line?</a></h2>
<p>
The reason for this is CVS committing DOS-style text files (i.e. with &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; line endings) 
as UNIX-style text files (with &lt;LF&gt; line endings).
There are many ways how this can happen, so first some general rules:
</p>
<ul>
<li>You should *only* access a repository using CVSNT, either directly from the command line or through 
wrapper applications like WinCVS or TortoiseCVS that use CVSNT internally.</li>
<li>It's highly recommended not to access your sandbox (that was checked out 
with TortoiseCVS, CVSNT or WinCVS) using other CVS clients, especially not with UNIX-style CVS clients (like Linux's 
or Cygwin's) because of line ending incompatibilities. </li>
<li>
It's highly recommended to use TortoiseCVS *only* for sandboxes that were checked out with TortoiseCVS, WinCVS or CVSNT - for example,
files checked out with the Eclipse CVS client may be treated as UNIX files by TortoiseCVS, which causes the additional &lt;CR&gt;.</li>
<li>Furthermore, you have to be careful when you've checked out a module using UNIX line endings. You must not
edit those files with a Windows text editor that overwrites the UNIX line endings with DOS line endings, or
else you'll eventually get that additional &lt;CR&gt; at the end of each line.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
If the above satisfies you, stop here.
If you'd like to know the details, continue reading.
</p>
<p>
<h3>The technical details</h3>
<p>
Okay, I've warned you ;)
</p> 
<p>
In Windows, text file line endings consist of the byte sequence &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; ($0D$0A),
while UNIX line endings only consist of a single &lt;LF&gt; ($0A). Loading a UNIX-style 
text file on Windows (or vice versa) may cause errors. Therefore, to 
be able to share text files across platforms, line endings have to be converted. 
</p>
<p>
CVS internally stores line endings in UNIX style. So when committing a Windows-style
text file to CVS, &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; has to be converted to &lt;LF&gt; before storing it on the CVS server. 
The opposite when updating: When a text file is downloaded from the CVS server, 
&lt;LF&gt; has to be converted to &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; before writing it to a sandbox on a Windows system.
CVSNT by default does all those conversions automatically.
</p>
<p>
But other CVS clients don't do those conversions. Now, assume you commit a 
Windows-style text file using a non-CVSNT client. As this CVS client won't
convert the line endings before uploading the file to CVS, the server 
repository will contain &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; line endings instead of &lt;LF&gt;. This leads to the 
following problems:
</p>
<ul>
<li>If you check out the file on UNIX (where no conversion is performed), the 
line endings will be &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; and not &lt;LF&gt;, which is wrong.</li>
<li>If you check out the file on Windows using CVSNT, it will convert each &lt;LF&gt; 
to a &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; to set the corret line endings for Windows. Unfortunately, the server
copy of the file already *had* a &lt;CR&gt; before the &lt;LF&gt;. As a result, the local line
endings will be &lt;CR&gt;&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; - the file is totally screwed up.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
BTW: The above applies only to text files - binary files (keyword expansion -kb) 
are never converted.
</p>

<p>
<h3>UNIX line endings on Windows</h3>
<p>
As you might know, TortoiseCVS has the option to check out modules using UNIX line endings. 
When the user modifies and commits a file in a UNIX sandbox, TortoiseCVS assumes that this file has UNIX line
endings, and passes a "--lf" to CVSNT on the commandline, which instructs CVSNT to treat the file as one with 
UNIX line endings.
</p>
<p>
To detect whether a module was checked out with UNIX line endings, TortoiseCVS looks at the CVS administrative files
in the CVS subdirectory: If the line endings for those files are in UNIX style, a UNIX sandbox is assumed. 
Unfortunately, there are some CVS clients (e.g. Eclipse) which create those files without a 
single line ending, so TortoiseCVS cannot detect them as UNIX sandbox. There's a preference setting that instructs
TortoiseCVS whether to default to DOS or UNIX in such cases.
</p>


<h2><a name="lotsofmodules">Can I work on lots of modules from different
repositories at once?</a></h2>
<p>
Yes, you can.  This is a standard feature
of CVS.  Each directory which was checked out of CVS remembers where it
came from (look at the files in the local subfolder called CVS to find
out how).  You can even multiply select modules which came from
different places, and update or commit them all at once.

<p>Some people have been known to reboot between changing repositories
to change their CVSROOT environment variable.  You do <b>not</b> need to
do this!  You don't even need to set a CVSROOT environment variable.

<h2><a name="columns">How can I automatically display the CVS columns in Explorer for each CVS-controlled folder?</a></h2>
<p>
TortoiseCVS already tells Explorer to always display the CVS columns, but 
it may not always work due to your Explorer settings. 
<p>
If you use the "Remember each folder's view settings" folder option, the colums displayed 
in a particular shell view may be restored from the registry, so in this 
case the CVS columns may not be visible. Resetting the all 
folder view settings should allow the CVS columns to be on by default. You can 
do this in the Folder Options dialog in Explorer (or through Control Panel).
<p>
<h2><a name="slowshell">TortoiseCVS seems to slow down Windows Explorer. What can I do?</a></h2>
<p>
CVS wasn't originally designed to provide file status information for large 
amounts of files in minimal time, so TortoiseCVS has to do quite a bit of work 
before it can tell Explorer which overlay icons to display and what to write
in the additional CVS columns in case they're enabled.
<p>
We recommend that you generally disable TortoiseCVS for as many folders as 
possible. You probably only need TortoiseCVS's features for a few sandbox folders
on your PC, so there is no point in having it turned on for the remaining folders, 
thereby decreasing overall system performance:
</p>

<ul>
<li>You can disable TortoiseCVS for removable drives and network shares in 
Preferences -> Policy. (This is already disabled by default).
</li>
<li>You can exclude additional folders in Preferences -> Advanced, or even 
better selectively include only the folders that actually contain 
CVS-controlled files.<br>
For example, set "Included folders" to "C:\mysandbox1;D:\mysandbox2" to
selectively enable TortoiseCVS only for those folders (and subfolders).
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<h2><a name="ssh">How does TortoiseCVS work with SSH?</a></h2>
<p>
SSH is supported transparently via TortoiseCVS. If you
checkout a CVSROOT using the "Secure shell (:ext:)" protocol TortoiseCVS
will attempt to connect to the server using "PuTTy". The SSH support
works as follows:

<ul>

<li>On your first connection to an SSH
server you will be prompted to add the server to the local registry of
"known hosts". If you trust the server you're connecting to, then select
"Yes". The message box will not appear again for any actions to this
server and you will be able to continue with your action. If you choose
"No" you will be able to continue with the action, but this message box
will appear for every CVS action you perform. If you choose "Cancel"
then the entire operation will be cancelled.</li>

<li> Every time you connect you will be prompted to provide your password.
See the next question if this annoys you.</li>

</ul>

<p>
<h2><a name="puttysessions">How do I use SSH to work with different servers that need different SSH parameter sets?</a></h2><p>
The "SSH parameters" in the "Preferences Dialog" are global settings, i.e. TortoiseCVS uses them for every SSH connection. 
This can be a problem if you need to use different SSH parameter sets for different servers.
For example if server1 needs to be accessed through a proxy, and server2 doesn't, 
or server1 needs a different private key file than server2.<p>
<p>You can handle that by creating different PuTTY sessions:
<ul>
<li>Download PuTTY from the 
<a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html">PuTTY
website</a>.</li>
<li>Use PuTTY to create separate PuTTY sessions for each SSH server. Set the session parameters 
(server name, SSH version etc.) as you need them. Don't forget to save the session settings.</li>
<li>Try to connect to your server using PuTTY and the newly created PuTTY session. If you're not able to establish a connection, 
TortoiseCVS won't be either.</li>
<li>When doing a "CVS Checkout", specify the PuTTY session name instead of the actual servername. TortoiseCVS will connect 
to the server specified in the PuTTY session using the session's connection parameters.</li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="ssh2">Does TortoiseCVS support SSH v2.0?</a></h2>
<p>
Yes. Set the "SSH parameters" in the "Preferences Dialog" 
under the "SSH" tab to <tt>-2</tt>, or <a href="#puttysessions">create a PuTTY session</a> and 
change the SSH configuration settings accordingly.

<h2><a name="sourceforge">Any tips for working with SourceForge?</a></h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>The SourceForge staff maintains an official document on using TortoiseCVS with SourceForge
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?group_id=1&docid=25888">here</a>.
<li>There is a detailed article available in the <a href="UserGuide_en.chm">User Guide</a>.
<li>Alistair Bayley has contributed <a href="ssh.shtml">this explanation</a>.
<li>The <a href="#sshkeys">following question</a> explains how to use SourceForge without having to type
 in the password every time you do something.
<li>If you get an error saying something like
"<i>Could not chdir to home directory /home/users/r/rd/rdonkin: No such file or directory</i>" then
you need to log into the server with SSH to force creation of your home directory.  Do this by connecting
to <tt>username@cvs.projectname.sf.net</tt> either with PuTTY or a command line SSH.
</ul>

<h2><a name="sshkeys">When using SSH, how do I make it so I don't need
to enter the password every time I do anything?</a></h2>

<p>You need to make a public/private key pair.  The public key goes on
the server, and the private key sits on your hard drive.  Now, when you
connect the server can verify who you are because only you have your
private key.

<p>To further protect your private key it is encrypted on your hard disk
with a passphrase.  You can however choose an empty passphrase, in which
case you never have to enter a password but anyone with access to your
computer can access your SSH CVS account.  Or you can use an SSH Agent
(such as Pageant) which will remember your passphrase for the duration
of one session, so you only have to enter it once.

<p>TortoiseCVS uses a version of Plink as its SSH client.  This means
you can use PuTTYgen to make a public/private key pair, and you can use
Pageant to point to where the private key is.  First of all download
them both from the
<a
href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html">PuTTY
website</a>.

<p>For information on how to use them read the
<a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/docs.html">PuTTY
documentation</a> on PuTTYgen and Pageant.
In particular, make sure you read the sections "8.2: Using PuTTYgen,
the PuTTY key generator" and "9.3.1 Making Pageant automatically load
keys on startup".

<p><b>Using SourceForge?</b>  After making your public key with PuTTYgen
you need to upload it using the web interface.  Log into the SourceForge
web site, and go to your Account Options page.  Down at the bottom
is a section "Host Access Information" with a link titled "Edit SSH Keys for Shell/CVS".  
You need to add your public key there.
<p>
You may need to force Plink to use SSH protocol version 2. To do this, add <tt>-2</tt>
at the end of the "SSH parameters" in Preferences.
<p>
<b>Too lazy to do all this?</b>  There is an alternative solution, which is
insecure as it keeps your password in plaintext on your machine.
Go to TortoiseCVS Preferences -&gt; SSH -&gt; SSH parameters and set
the value to <tt>-pw <i>password</i></tt>. But really, that would be an
abuse of SSH.  So if anyone asks, I didn't tell you about it, OK?
And <b>please</b> don't ask for us to add password caching to TortoiseCVS. We won't do it.

<h2><a name="sshcygwin">I'm using TortoiseCVS with Cygwin's SSH, why
doesn't it work?</a></h2>
<p>
If you've got spaces, quotes, or other non-alphabetical characters in your global 
HOME environment variable, then Cygwin may not cope.  You need to change it.
<p>
<h2><a name="sshport">I need to specify a different SSH port but TortoiseCVS won't let me?</a></h2>
<p>
The reason is because CVSNT, which TortoiseCVS relies on for all CVS actions, does not
allow specifying the port for using the SSH protocol in the CVSROOT like other protocols.
To setup TortoiseCVS to use a different SSH port go to TortoiseCVS 
Preferences -> SSH -> SSH parameters and set the value to 
<tt>-P <i>portnumber</i></tt>, or <a href="#puttysessions">create a PuTTY session</a> and 
change the SSH configuration settings accordingly.
<p>
<h2><a name="rsh">Why is RSH (.rhosts) no longer supported, and what do
I do about it?</a></h2>
<p>
TortoiseCVS does not support RSH using the :server: protocol.  
This is because it uses <a href="http://www.cvsnt.org">CVSNT</a>
rather than the main version of CVS.  We've made several attempts to resolve
this but have been unable to do so easily, and have found no support from
anyone who uses RSH.  You have a choice on how to deal with this:

<ul>
<li><b>Change to using another protocol.</b> Since RSH is very insecure
anyway, you will be in an environment where pserver could be used
instead.  Many more people use pserver, and persuading your server
administrator to change may be worthwhile.  On an NT domain you will
find :sspi: much more convenient.
<li><b>Use :ext: with an rsh.exe. </b> Go to TortoiseCVS preferences and
on the SSH page change the SSH application to point to an instance of
rsh.exe.  Then checkout your module using SSH protocol.
<p>There is a shareware rsh.exe which works with this that is called
<a href="http://www.ataman.com/archives/arshd95_cv.zip">ARSHD95</a>
(thanks to Daniel Jackson for pointing this out). You want the client
from in that package, not the server. If you find an open source rsh.exe
that works with this, please 
<a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/tortoisecvs-users">mail us</a> so we can tell others
here, and add support via :ext: (see below).
<li><b>Use a different cvs.exe. </b>  Don't do this, unless you want to
get into trouble with daylight saving time issues.  Only CVSNT properly
deals with them, and TortoiseCVS now relies on this.
<li><b>Add support to CVSNT and/or TortoiseCVS. </b>  This is much
easier to do than it sounds, and there are two slightly different ways
of doing it.
	<ul>
	<li>Change TortoiseCVS to use the new ext protocol syntax :ext:{ssh}foo@bar:/usr/local/cvs.
	This is available from version cvsnt 1.11.1.3 build 57b of CVSNT.  Doing this requires a
	quality rsh.exe - please tell us what rsh.exe you have used!
	<li>Create a new server_protocol.dll, probably based on the pserver one.  Grab the source code
	for the main version of CVS, and steal rcmd.c from it and the :server: code that calls that.  Use
	this to make native RSH support inside a server_protocol.dll.
	</ul>
Of course if you do any of this, <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/tortoisecvs-users">let us know</a>.
</ul>

<h2><a name="eclipse">Using TortoiseCVS together with Eclipse</a></h2>
<p>
The <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> IDE has a built-in SSH client, activated in its CVS browser by
using the "extssh" protocol string. It's functionally equivalent to using
the "ext" protocol string, but eliminates the need for an external SSH
client. This is fine when only Eclipse is used, but as Tortoise doesn't
support the protocol, only its offline features will be available.
<p>
The workaround is the following:
<ol>
<li>In Eclipse, go to Window -> Preferences -> Team -> CVS -> Ext
connection method. For CVS_RSH, hit the browse button and find
TortoisePlink.exe. The other settings are fine at their defaults.
<li>In Eclipse, create a new Repository Location using ext, not extssh.
Connect and checkout your project.
</ol>
The CVS metadata folders now contain a connection string that TortoiseCVS can
use. Both Eclipse and TortoiseCVS (and WinCVS, I imagine) now offer their
full featureset.
<p>
On the downside, Eclipse will now ask for your password for every CVS
operation. How to work around this is already in the Tortoise FAQ.
<p>
<h2><a name="exclusive">How do I enable exclusive locking or announcing edits?</a></h2>
<p>
<p>
Here's a brief overview of how it works:
<ul>
<li>You must have set 'cvs watch on' for the repository (you only have to do this manually
if you have previously used another client to add files, otherwise TortoiseCVS will have
done it for you).
<li>When you do a CVS Checkout or CVS Update, the working files will be created as read-only.
<li>To change a file, use the command 'CVS Edit'. This command works slightly differently
depending on whether the file is text or binary.
<li>For <i>binary</i> files (such as .doc), TortoiseCVS first checks if another user is
already editing the file. If this is the case, you will not be allowed to edit it.
<li>For <i>text</i> files (such as .txt or .cpp), you may work on the file even if another user
is already working on it; in this case, TortoiseCVS will notify you of that fact.
<li>When you are done working on the file, just use 'CVS Commit' as usual.
<li>If you decide that you do not want to change the file after all, use 'CVS Unedit'.
TortoiseCVS will ask you if you want to revert the file to the original version (thus
losing your changes).
<li>To see which files are currently being edited and by whom, use the command
'Show edited files' on the CVS submenu.
</ul>
<p>
<h2><a name="binary">How does TortoiseCVS handle binary files?</a></h2>
<p>
CVS can automatically merge text files if two people change them at the same time,
but it doesn't do so with binary files.  It simply says there is a conflict,
gives you a copy of both files, and lets you resolve it.  Because of this
you may want to use text files wherever possible.  For example, use HTML
or persuade Word to save as a text XML file.
</p>

<p>
TortoiseCVS tries to automatically detect whether a file is binary or text when
you add it:
<ul>
<li>
Files with certain extensions, such as .doc and .exe, are always assumed to be binary. 
Other extensions, such as .cpp and .txt, are always assumed to be text.
TortoiseCVS' built-in list of binary extensions includes most common extensions; to customize the list, 
copy the file TortoiseCVS.Filetypes into your HOME folder and edit it.
(You can even write a custom DLL for detecting the type of a file - see TortoiseCVS.Filetypes for details).
<li>
For other files TortoiseCVS examines the first few bytes of a file to determine the type.
If the file type cannot be detected with confidence, TortoiseCVS will force you to decide.
</ul>
In all cases, the Add Files dialog presents the files you are about to add and the type
of each one, so that you have a chance to correct the choices made.
<p>
Binary files are stored unchanged by CVS.  Text files have their
line end characters converted for different operating systems, and <a
href="http://cvshome.org/docs/manual/cvs_12.html#SEC98">keywords expanded</a>
so you can easily tell who last changed a file and when.
</p>
<p>
If you want extra confidence than the automatic binary/text detection, read the
section about <a href="http://cvshome.org/docs/manual/cvs_9.html#SEC80">binary
files</a> in the CVS manual.  Then add an entry to the cvswrappers file to
ensure files with specific extensions are stored as binary.  This won't
stop TortoiseCVS prompting you, but it will ensure that even if you
accidentally choose text the wrappers file will override this for binary
file extensions.

<h2><a name="cvsinit">How do I set up a personal repository to use
without a server?</a></h2>
<p>
You don't need any other software installed to make a local
repository.  Simply follow these steps:

<ol>
<li>Prepare a folder with the files you want under version control.
<li>Right click on the folder and choose Make New Module from the CVS submenu.
<li>Select the "Locally mounted directory" protocol.
<li>In the directory section, enter where you would like your repository to be.
<li>After selecting OK, you will be asked to confirm creation of a new
repository.  Select the checkbox to confirm this, and click OK.
<li>You can now add the files within your folder to CVS, and work with
it as described in the <a href="UserGuide_en.chm">User's Guide</a>.
</ol>

<p>TortoiseCVS can also offer to initialise a new repository on a
remote server, provided you have permissions.

<p>
<h2><a name="flags">Can I customise the flags sent to CVS?</a></h2>
<p>
To some extent you can.  Make a file in your home directory called <i>.cvsrc</i>.
You can find where the home directory is by doing CVS->Preferences.  The format of <i>.cvsrc</i>
is <a href="http://www.cvshome.org/docs/manual/cvs_16.html#SEC116">explained here</a>.

<p>For example, if you want to use -F on all tag commands so it moves tags, add the
line "tag -F" to <i>.cvsrc</i>.
