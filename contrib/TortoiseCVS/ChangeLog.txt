changing the type associated with a particular extension. (Hartmut)

by Geoff Beier. (Torsten)

Fixed stupid bug in previous version of CVSEntries.cpp. (Torsten)

Applied patch [632214] "Adds columns to HistoryDialog". (Torsten)

[606076] "1.0.X - Empty folders containing only CVS folder". (Torsten)

Fixed bug [609214] "1.x.x TortoiseShell fails in a root directory". (Torsten)

Applied patch from Geoff Beier for bug [637325] "Don't bring progress dialog
to front". (Torsten)

Fixed bug where read-only files were always being shown with the "In CVS,
read-only" icon even if the file was in fact not in CVS. Thanks to Ian
Epperson for pointing this out. (Torsten)

In the Checkout dialog, the OK button is now disabled while the module list is
being fetched. (Torsten)

Fixed bug [638130] "1.1.7 Can't "CVS Add" *.exe". (Torsten)

Make New Module dialog: Module is no longer changed when you click an entry in
the CVSROOT history. (Torsten)

Make New Module dialog: Size grip no longer overlays Cancel button. (Torsten)

username is entered. (Torsten)

Fixed bug that caused -r to always be added when doing an export (thanks to
John Pedersen for reporting this). (Torsten)

When an error occurs during execution of a CVS command, TortoiseCVS now plays
an error sound. The installer sets a default sound for this event; open
Control Panel/Sounds and Multimedia to select another sound. (Torsten)

Applied several patches from Hartmut Honisch:
- You can now specify the port in the Checkout dialog
- Resizable dialogs now have a "resize grip"
- In the file "Filetypes.config", you can now specify file extensions that

-----------------------------------

Fixed bug [614553] "Minor bug - SSH App Browse Button". (Torsten)

Improvements to History and Revision Graph dialogs. Removed revision list on
property page. (Torsten)

Removed "core" from default ignore list, so that TortoiseCVS again handles
directories named "core". (Torsten)

Reread default ignore list (from %HOME/.cvsignore) after 100 seconds. (Torsten)

Applied Geoff Beier's patch for bug [530319] "0.xx Administrative rights for
installation". (Torsten)

Offer to reboot after installation. (Torsten)

Fixed bug [604494] "CVS Unedit problem". (Torsten)

Icon overlays are no longer shown for WebDrive volumes. (Torsten)

Avoid passing -c to 'cvs commit', since that does not work if the server is
not CVSNT. (Torsten)

Fixed bug [605425] "Dialog title has errant ampersand". (Torsten)

Move properly to latest CVS version of wxWindows, hopefully fixed all
the errors we were getting before in message handlers.  If you get access
violations in any dialogs, please let us know, as we probably know what it
is! (Francis)

Fixed bug in "Add Contents" which didn't properly add nested folders,
thanks to Aaron Kynaston for finding it (Francis)

Updated CVSNT to build 57h. (Torsten)

Changes for 1.1.2 (4 September 2002):
-------------------------------------

Fixed bug [598634] "hide the "Commit" menu if it's useless". (Torsten)

Fixed bug [530319] "0.xx Administrative rights for installation". (Torsten)

Fixed problem with bogus removable drive detection on Win95/98, had
the symptom that menus sometimes wouldn't work. (Francis)

Added flex/bison to CVS. (Francis/Torsten)

runs CVSNT. Closes bug 583800. (Torsten)

Various fixes for History and Revision Graph dialogs. (Torsten)

Allow entering user name for SSPI. (Torsten)

Implemented feature request [533643] "Check for CVSROOT environment
variable". (Torsten)

Show value of CVSROOT in progress dialog. (Francis)

Fixed bug [589924] "diff of binary file fails". (Torsten)

Added support for adding files and file extensions to .cvsignore. (Torsten)

Maybe fixed installation problem in Win98 by changing PostInst.  Now changes
the cvs executable registry setting if it is currently an empty string.  Also
leaves PostInst.exe about after install, so you can run it again for testing
and debugging. (Francis)

Changes for 1.1.1 (19 August 2002):
-----------------------------------

Added About dialog. (Torsten)

Fixed bug [596353] "update special" calendar". (Torsten)

Fixed bug [591134] "Add All Recursively does not add files". (Torsten)

Fixed bug [571645] "Merge should do Edit first". (Torsten)

Fixed bug [561877] "0.50 Commands Fail when CVS in top level dir". (Torsten)

Applied patch [571611] "Switch -x Data Encryption (sspi/gserver)" from Joakim
Beijar. (Torsten)

Fixed bug [558859] "Case Sensitive" by making CVSStatus use case-insensitive
compare. (Torsten)

Update dialog now fills in revision only when box checked again (for
a while it could add the ghosted revision text in, I think). (Francis)

Attempted fix for doing "cvs login" with SSPI at the right time. (Francis)

Various usability improvements to the checkout dialog, including right
click on history list to remove old CVSROOT entries.  Still more stuff
to do... (Francis)

Fixed bug [589493] Can now perform actions directly on "My Documents", or 
indeed any shell namespace folder which has a pathname.  I've reduced and 
rewritten a big chunk of the ShellExt code, and hopefully haven't broken 
anything else.  Please check things like columns and property page 
work (Francis)

Fixed bug [528170] Right click in commit dialog now selects, also added
in double clicking now does stuff [534738]. (Francis)

Add All Recursively replaced by Add Contents.  This now works on directories
which already have some CVS files in them.  It brings up a dialog with a list
of the files that it is going to add.  This least already ignores cvsignore specified files. 
As elsewhere in TortoiseCVS, that is .cvsignore and $HOME/.cvsignore files, not yet
the remote CVSROOT/cvsignore file. (Francis)

Tag, branch and merge dialogs now have a button to get a list of tag/branches,
making it easier for you to reselect one, or pick a similar name for a 
new one. (Francis)

Added manifest so it appears with themes in XP.  Please shout up if there
are any problems caused by this.  Made 48x48 versions of overlay icons
for Windows XP.  (Francis)

Changes for 1.1.0 (2 August 2002):
----------------------------------

Added workaround for CVSNT bug where 'edit -c' does not work
correctly. (Torsten)

Fixed bug [568087] "0.53 "Make New Module" fails (pserver & CVSNT Server)". (Torsten)

Added TortoiseTip for case sensitivity issue, as partly described here
http://ccvs.cvshome.org/fom/cache/131.html (Francis)

Cope with tigris web server saying 'cvs login' rather than "cvs login" (Francis)

Fixed bug in IsLeapYear() (submitted by Will Dean). (Torsten)

Fixed bug [542998] "0.45 Progress dialog doesn't scroll to bottom". (Torsten)

Icon overlays now obey .cvsignore (currently only $HOME/.cvsignore and the one
in the current directory are searched, not the one in $CVSROOT/CVSROOT). (Torsten)

Remove no longer deletes files; it leaves a copy named '.#filename.removed.extension'. (Francis)

Implemented feature request [558205] "Taskbar-friendly progress window
titles". (Torsten)

Implemented feature request [559807] "Add Win2k support for HOME directory". (Torsten)

Fixed bug [564501] "Make Patch fails for Sourceforge repos.". (Torsten)

You can now use the new History dialog to view the revision history of a
file. (Torsten)

New Revision Graph dialog to view the revision graph of a file. (Torsten)

Icon overlays are no longer shown for removable drives (floppy, CD-ROM
etc.). This also avoids accessing A: drive when Explorer is started. (Torsten)

Added accelerator keys to some of the dialogs. (Torsten)

Applied compilation fixes for MSVC 7 from Sven Axelsson. (Torsten)

A new set of icons has been contributed by Mathias Hasselmann. (Torsten)

Revision numbers are now sorted correctly on the property page. (Torsten)

The Create Tag dialog is now simply called 'Tag'. (Torsten)

Fixed bug [557099] "0.xx Revision list on Property Sheet too big". (Torsten)

In the Update Special dialog, you can now specify a date as well as a
revision. (Torsten)

The dialog formerly known as "Create Tag" is now simply called "Tag" to
reflect the new possibilities. (Torsten)

Web Log and Help now always opens a new browser window instead of reusing an
existing window (closes feature request [537084] "Web Log in new IE
Window"). (Torsten)

When viewing the properties of a file, under the CVS tab you can now do diffs
between older versions and/or an old version with current version.  (Powers)
Brief user guide: 
- To diff a revision against the working file, just right click and select Diff.
- To diff one revision against another, mark the first revision by
  left-clicking, then mark the other revision using Ctrl-left click. Finally
  right click and select Diff.

On same tab as above, you can do a "Get" on a single file.  This is equivalent to
"cvs update -r <ver/tag> <filename>".  (Powers)


Changes for 0.54 (26 June 2002):
-------------------------------

Fixed bug [560320] "Commit Limited to 2/3 Files Per Use". (Torsten)

Fixed problems with running several instances of TortoiseAct.exe at the same
time. (Torsten)

Fixed bug [528787] "0.xx Web log fails on password secure sites". (Torsten)

Updated CVS to CVSNT 1.11.1.3 Build 57f to fix memory problems.


Changes for 0.53 (1 June 2002):
-------------------------------

In Preferences/External diff application and Preferences/Conflict Editor, it
is now also possible to select .bat and .cmd files. Closes feature request
[559173] "Run a batch (.bat) file on "Diff"". (Torsten)

Updated CVS to CVSNT 1.11.1.3 Build 57d to fix problems with SSH zombie
processes. (Torsten)

Network compression level now defaults to None to avoid problems with some
servers hanging. (Torsten)

Changes for 0.52 (13 May 2002):
-------------------------------

CVS Add was accidentally broken in 0.51 when adding directories. Fixed. (Torsten)

The Create Tag dialog now has a set of radio buttons for selecting Create,
Move, or Delete Tag. (Torsten)

Changes for 0.51 (6 May 2002):
------------------------------

A new set of icons has been contributed by Stefan Bertels. (Torsten)

Unicode support: When adding a Unicode file (autodetected or chosen by user)
TortoiseCVS now uses the CVSNT option '-ku'. (Torsten)

Improved text/binary detection, including Unicode support. TortoiseCVS now
knows that certain file types such as .c, .cpp, .txt etc are always text
(ASCII or Unicode). Files containing ISO-Latin characters are now reliably
detected as text. (Torsten)

The progress dialog is now colour coded in WinCVS fashion. (Torsten)

The Edit/Unedit commands now use 'cvs edit -c' instaed of 'cvs admin -l'. This
addresses bugs [528639] "0.47 Unedit doesn't get the right username", and
[533699], "0.48 Unedit issue".
Removed List Locked Files command (no longer needed).
Removed exclusive edit command (it never worked properly anyway). (Torsten)

'cvs watch on' is now only run when a new module is created. (Torsten)

Avoid launching an excessive number of conflict editor windows. (Torsten)

Avoid launching the conflict editor on binary files. (Torsten)

Fixed bug in Diff where the temporary file was deleted too early. This meant
that if the external diff application was not found the first time, the file
was gone when the user had selected the correct application. (Torsten)

Fixed bug [543220], "0.45 "Many files" overflows piped buffer.

Added tip as suggested in tracker item [528788], "0.xx Case-insensitive files
causes problem." (Torsten)

Fixed bug [528180], "Wrong CVSROOT". (Torsten)

When Create Tag fails (e.g. because the tag is rejected by 'taginfo'),
TortoiseCVS now remembers the tag name on the next attempt. (Torsten)

Added support for Windows 95/98/ME, fixing bug [538630], "0.46 CVS not
working on Win95/98". (Torsten)

Do not call CVS with a files argument of ".". Doing so can cause CVS to check
out an entire repository (and delete the other modules again) when you do an
update. (Torsten)

TortoisePlink now exits if you click Cancel in the password dialog, thereby
partly addressing bug [545398], "0.50 SSH wrong password cancel
ignored".

When doing a CVS Commit, the progress dialog was shown before the commit
dialog. (Torsten)

Make Patch works again now. (Torsten)

Changes for 0.50 (15 April 2002):
---------------------------------

Fixed minor bug in installer. (Francis)

Added new preference option 'Automatic unedit' for use with 'Watch
on'. (Torsten)

FAQ updated regarding SSH usage. (Martin, Francis)

FAQ updated regarding Edit/Unedit. (Torsten)

Changes for 0.49 (11 April 2002):
---------------------------------

Seamless SSH support! TortoiseCVS now uses its own special SSH client,
TortoisePlink (a hacked version of Plink from the PuTTY suite), which means
that no configuration is needed for using SSH. (Torsten)

TODO: The FAQ entries regarding SSH need to be rewritten.

RSH is officially not supported out the box.  See the entry in the FAQ for
more information.  You can help us fix this if you care.  (Francis)

Make new module now works without making spurious subfolders, and for local
and remote repositories. (Georgi Beloev, patch applied by Francis).

Explorer resource leak in owner draw menus cleaned up, bug #531423. (Francis)

Weblog should now work for nonstandard ports (still does not work if a
passsword is required, though) (see tracker item 528334). (Torsten)

Fix for the scenario where there is a cvs.exe in the PATH, but the TortoiseCVS
install directory is not in the PATH. (Torsten)

The Edit/Unedit commands could crash if CVSStatus::GetOptions() returned
NULL. Fix: Call HasOptions() first. (Reported by Volker Abel) (Torsten)

Added support for :gserver: and :sspi: protocols to the checkout dialog. (Torsten)

Disable owner draw when shell extensions not installed, so menus appear
on native Windows NT. (Torsten and Francis)

Changes for 0.48 (22 March 2002):
---------------------------------

Daylight savings fix (updated stat function) from WinCVS applied. (Francis)

IMPORTANT NOTE:  You must fix the incorrect CVS/Entries files for every 
directory checked out on your computer. Server repositories are not affected
and don't need to be changed or fixed.  The easiest way to fix them is
to perform a CVS-->Update.

Checkout TortoiseCVS option uses new SourceForge project (Francis)

Can now enter quotes in comments in checkout dialog again. (Francis)

Plink is now included instead of ssh. (Torsten)

CVSNT 1.11.1.3 is now included instead of the standard CVS 1.11.1p1. (Torsten)

Canonicalize URL for weblog (fix contributed by Pierre). (Torsten)

Explorer detail column for 'CVS Sticky Tag' now shows nothing if no sticky tag
or date is in effect (previously it would show "Head" in this case)
(suggested by Christian Hargraves).  (Torsten)

Fixed bug where an extraneous '=' was appended to some environment 
variables - this caused RSH access to fail. (Torsten)

Automatically offers to "cvs init" a new repository if you try
and access one with an invalid directory.  Useful if you just
want to use CVS locally - you can just Make New Module, and do
everything with TortoiseCVS.  (Francis)

Various bug fixes to new CVSROOT parsing stuff in checkout dialog.
Choosing : in directory names should work again now.  (Francis)

Changes for 0.47 (09 March 2002):
---------------------------------

Bugfix for CVSEditExclusive from Joe Navratil. (Torsten)

Checkout dialog now features a box you can paste CVSROOT
values directly into, and a history of previous CVSROOT/modules
which you have checked out.  Now there are 3 different ways
to enter the same information, I'm worried it might be too confusing.
Clarifying suggestions welcome! (Francis)

Password entry now works with CVSNT (tested with 1.11.1.3). (Torsten)

Option to automatically launch a conflict editor (see
http://sourceforge.net/projects/conflicteditor/) when a conflict
occurs on update. (Torsten)

Option to automatically perform a commit after an add. (Torsten)

Improved weblog error reporting. (Torsten)

Minor change in installation script to ensure that 
TortoiseMenus.config is in sync with TortoiseShell.dll after a 
new install. (Torsten)

Tortoise icon on context menu should now always line up.  i.e. The text
to the right of the Tortoise (CVS Update etc.) should be exactly aligned
with other items on the context menu.  I've tested it on NT, 2000 and 98.
Please try on 95 and XP.  If it doesn't line up, try CVS->Prefs->Quirky
and change the icon size to small/medium/large to see which is correct.
Then let me know which size your OS.  (Francis)

Shortcut .lnk and Internet .url files can now be added to repositories.
In the case of shortcuts, you are given menu items for both the source and
the target where appropriate. Please check this works for you, as it needs
new registry keys which I've added to the installer, but haven't tested.  
(Francis)

General bug fix for the new cvs.exe, to do with performing commands
on top level directories.  See comments in TortoiseAct::PreprocessFileList
for more details.  (Francis)

"Clean Update" replaced by "Update Special..." which now offers
all update options, including cleaning.  (Francis)

Fetch module list button in checkout dialog, replacing the list
modules menu item.  (Francis)

Preference to change the CVS executable used.  (Francis).

Right click context menu in commit dialog would sometimes have
non-functioning menu items, fixed.  Patch applied by Francis. (Juan)

Changes for 0.46 (16 February 2002):
------------------------------------

Oops - CVS Commit was not shown unless 'Watch on' was enabled 
in preferences.

Changes for 0.45 (15 February 2002):
------------------------------------

Files with certain extensions such as .doc etc. are now always
treated as binary, thus overriding the default text/binary
detection mechanism. Related to bug 365. (Torsten)

The option "Close If No Error" has been renamed to "Close
Automatically" and now offers more choices. (Torsten)

Added "SSH" page to Preferences dialog. (Francis)

The progress dialog now uses a rich edit control. This solves
the problem I observed e.g. when checking out TortoiseCVS, where
the last part of the CVS output was not shown. Also allows
using different colours in the dialog in the future. (Torsten)

Added options page to Checkout dialog, with options for export
(ie no admin dirs) and for overriding the name of the checkout dir.
(BenC)

Several new features related to using 'cvs watch on':
- Added new verb 'CVSListEditors' which does a 'cvs editors'.
- The 'CVS Lock' and 'CVS Unlock' commands added in 0.44 are now
  replaced by 'CVS Edit' and 'CVS Unedit'. For binary files,
  these work the same way as the old ones (i.e. cvs
  update+cvs edit+cvs admin -l and cvs admin -u+cvs unedit,
  respectively); for text files, they just cvs edit and cvs
  unedit, respectively.
- Added new verb 'CVSEditExclusive' which always does cvs
  update+cvs edit+cvs admin -l.
- 'CVS Unedit' does not allow you to unlock a file locked by
  another user ('CVS Unlock' had this drawback).
- New command 'CVS List Locks' to show any locked files.
- All these commands are only shown if the new Preferences
  option "Watch on" (off by default) is selected, and they
  take the read-only status of the file into account.
  Also files which are in CVS, but read-only, are shown with
  a new icon.
- There is also a new option in Preferences to automatically
  open a 'CVS Edit'ed file using the application registered
  for the file type.
  This should close bug 703. Also related to bug 95.
- All this stuff needs to be properly documented.
  (Torsten) 

Integrated patch from Geoff Beier
(http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=503925&group_id=10072&atid=310072):
- better SSH integration
- option for pruning of empty directories
(Torsten)
With fix from Juan Carlos Arevalo-Baeza (Francis)

TortoiseCVS now uses an external cvs.exe instead of the
cvs2ntlib.dll. (Torsten)

Fixed missing quotes in TortoiseUtils.cpp causing problems
on temporary directories with spaces. (Martin)

Explorer detail colums for 'CVS Status', 'CVS Revision' and
'CVS Sticky Tag'. To activate the CVS columns: Right-click 
on the column headers bar (View Details only) in a CVS 
folder, select 'More...' and then checkoff the CVS columns 
you wish to activate, click 'OK'. To make the CVS columns 
appear always go to 'Tools'-> 'Folder Options'-> Click 
'Like Current Folder'. Note this feature only works on
Windows2000 or greater systems. If you're compiling you'll 
need to have the Plaform SDK November 2001 or later installed.
(Andy Hird)

New 'CVS Clean Update' command. Does a 'cvs -C update'.
(Torsten)
	 
New 'CVS List Modules' command. Does a 'cvs co -c'.
(Torsten)

Fixed bug 708. (Martin)

Fixed bug 717. (Torsten)

Changes for 0.44 (10 November 2001):
------------------------------------

This time some changes to encourage contributions:

Easily checkout TortoiseCVS and/or wxWindows source code
from a new menu option.  If you don't grab the wxWindows
source, you can still use the precompiled libraries for
Visual C++. (Francis)

Make Patch file option for submitting fixes to open source
projects.  (Francis)

And other stuff:

Preferences dialog now ghosts disabled options correctly,
has browse button where appropriate, and has multiple pages
with some new options. Fixed radio buttons on update dialog.
Other minor bugs. (Francis)

CVS Lock and CVS Unlock options which use "cvs edit" and
"cvs admin -l" to perform exclusive locks.  These commands
are not enabled by default, edit TortoiseMenus.config to
enable them.  Looking for a good way to enable them only
when they are required - read only files and/or "cvs watch
on". (Torsten Martinsen)

Fixed bug 636, Make New Module now clears up its temporary
directory before use.  Also copes better with making an
existing module - all the files from the existing module are
checked out on top of the ones you are trying to add.  You
even get an Explorer dialog if the file names clash ;)
(Francis)

Unix sandbox check.  This looks to see if your working
folder appears to have been checked out under Unix, and
warns you if it has.  Using a folder checked out on Unix
with Windows CVS can cause trouble. You can turn off this
check in preferences.  (Francis)

Fixed bug 550, C:\ home directory paths not working on
Win98.  (Francis)

Changes for 0.43 (11 June 2001):
-------------------------------

TortoiseCVS Daily Use guide written. Please read this and
let us know what you think. (BenC)

New installer using NSIS.  Please check this works for you!
New features are: Self extracting EXE with nicer interface,
start menu items, uninstallation in add/remove programs.
(Francis)

Icons on context menu.  Too large under NT? (Nathan and
Francis)

Changes for 0.42 (26 May 2001):
-------------------------------

Checkout no longer prunes empty directories. This is a
compromise that should be right for most people. (BenC)

Menu configuration is now read from config file (BenC)

Added a "CVS" property sheet to the file and directory.  It
displays the revision number, modification status, time
stamp, sticky tag, whether the file is binary, and a
revision history.  Sorting isn't quite right yet.  (Jon
Rowlands)

Commit dialog now only accepts comments with have some
non-whitespace characters in them.  Right click menu is now
a proper Explorer menu (where possible). (Francis)

Renamed the faux-import "Make New Module". (Francis)

Added context menu for directory background (right-click in
open directory window). This behaves the same as
right-clicking on the directory name in the parent
directory's window. (Jon Rowlands)

Allowed context menu in drive root directories. Includes a
horrible kludge to exclude drives A: and B: (need a better
way -- need to determine whether drive is removable, without
accessing drive).  (Jon Rowlands)

Fixed a bug in determining "modified" status. The strcmp()
can fail inappropriately because the VC++ asctime() function
doesn't produce the same format as UNIX (day of month has a
leading zero in VC++, not in UNIX). Worked around this by
treating zero and space as equivalent in that character
position. (Jon Rowlands)

Removed old version commmit as new one seems fine. (Francis)

Support for new Soureforge web log scheme. (Francis)

Borland compilation fixes, and hence code nearer to the C++
standard!  (Ian Dees)

Explorer window is now automatically refreshed for all
appropriate commands.  Let me know if there are cases where
it does refresh when it is annoying and doesn't need to, or
if there are cases where id doesn't refresh and it should.
(Francis)

Other things: Warning about user folders called "CVS", which
sometimes caused an infinite loop.  Various other tips and
improvements for when people have folders called "CVS". Bug
with diff if you login during the diff.  Tortoise Tip when
you (might) have the repository directory wrong.  Registry
handle leak fixed.  Finally got icon for TortoiseAct.exe
working.  (Francis)

Don't panic!

Changes for 0.41 (23 February 2001):
------------------------------------

No changes - but actually managed to ship the correct
TortoiseAct.exe this time!  Version 0.40 had an old version
of the executable, accidentally.

Changes for 0.40 (22 February 2001):
------------------------------------

Import command now works.  It is different from CVS import,
simpler (or less powerful, depending how you look at it!).
Right click on a folder that isn't in CVS, do CVS-->Import
and it will make a new module in the repository.  The folder
will now appear to be in CVS "in place". (Francis)

Automatically use WinCVS external diff if available.
(Francis)

Remote shell (rsh) support via :server:. (Francis)

Client logging registry key added properly.  This is
documented in help.html. (Francis)

Worked round bug in wxWindows where web log dialog crashed.
Tidied up web log code into a separate class. (Francis)

Changes for 0.37 (12 February 2001):
------------------------------------

WARNING: The new commit dialog may not be perfect.  It is
possible that it's scanning code could miss files that you
have changed, added or removed.  I haven't seen any problems
yet, but to find any, please do "CVS Commit... (old)" just
after a new style commit, to check everything has been
committed.

Added commit dialog.  Hooray!  At last.  It needs some
testing, as it uses new code partly-hacked from WinCVS to
recurisvely scan for changes (modified, added and removed
files). (Francis)

Compiled and linked TortoiseAct.exe with Mingw32.  This was
using a cross-compiler running under Linux, but it should
work for native Mingw32 as well. The resulting executable
doesn't work - memory allocation in STL is broken, so it
crashes on the first vector::push_back.  (Francis)

For directories, icon overlays can now show you if any files
within them have chagned.  This is too slow to be useful,
perhaps someone can profile it and make it really fast, but
I suspect it will always be a bit too slow.  To enable, add
a DWORD key "Show Changed Directories" with the value 1 to
HKCU/Software/TortoiseCVS. (Francis)

Removed password entry from CVS Checkout dialog.  It was
unnecessary, since CVSAction prompts you for the password
when necessary.  (Francis)

Changes for 0.36 (29 January 2001):
-----------------------------------

Threaded progress dialog.  Now it is more responsive during
long checkouts.  I'm sure it will introduce at least one new
problem though. (Francis)

Changed default of "Automatically close if no error" to
false.  I think it confuses non-experts? (Francis)

Added support for merging. Woohoo! (BenC)

Minor changes to add explanation text on tag/branch dialogs,
in order to make it more obvious what happens when you click
OK. (BenC)

Added options to update to retrieve specific revisions and
to reset sticky tags - hold down control key while updating
to bring up dialog box with these extra options. (BenC)

Stop Win2K floppy drive clicking in My Computer, by stopping
TortoiseCVS scanning top level drives.  I hope I've applied
his patch correctly, please check for me! (Stefan
Hoffmeister)

Borland compilation improvements (Stefan Hoffmeister)


Changes for 0.35 (8 January 2001):
----------------------------------

Completed first rough draft of wxWindows support.  This
means that all dialogs are now implemented with a native
Win32 widget set, using the wxWindows API to make it easier
to program them.  Some of the dialog layouts are rough at
the edges, and any help to make them prettier would be
welcomed! (Francis)

Changed process launching to use CreateProcess rather than
WinExec, which fixes problems with MessageBoxes not
appearing (Francis)

Recursive directory adding.  This is a new menu item
available when you select a directory which is not in CVS.
Currently it adds _all_ files - with .cvsignore support
later it should know better what to ignore.  Watch you don't
add too many files. (Francis)

Speeded up multiple file adding by adding all text files in
a directory in one command together, and then all the binary
files together. (Francis)


Changes for 0.34 (26 October 2000):
-----------------------------------

Initial Win32 user interface support (Didier Trosset)

[ This Win32 UI support is not yet in the binary release, as
some of the dialogs are not implemented.  I'm also
considering porting the whole lot to wxWindows - a cross
platform, Open Source widget-set layer, which also gives you
a genuine native Windows interface.
Suggestions/comments/help welcome. ]

Preferences dialog.  It's fairly easy to add new
preferences, so we'll have to try not to go overboard on
them. (Francis)

NT CVS Server support.  Hopefully works with either ntserver
or pserver protocol, although I couldn't test pserver.
(Francis)

Locally mounted directory support. (Francis)

Web log now scans for lots of URLs.  Suggestions for extra
ones are welcomed! (Francis)

Error handling for CVS Remove improved, so if there is an
error during removal you don't lose your file. (Francis)

Windows 95 registry bug fix - external diff program setting
(and others) will now be correctly remembered (Ian Dees)

Initial SSH support.  Very unfriendly, as it prompts for
your password every operation from a DOS window. (Francis)

Changes for 0.33 (released 11 October 2000):
--------------------------------------------

Fixed bug with commit on multiple files (to do with
separators and the new submenu) (Francis)

Added "HOME" registry value. If not present, "C:" is
assumed.  (ie .cvspass can now be relocated) (BenC)

Put Checkout on the main menu, rather than a submenu
(Francis)

Changes for 0.32 (released 2 October 2000):
-------------------------------------------

Checkout dlg now remembers servernames, usernames and
modules  (BenC)

Checkout can now specify branch, tag and/or date  (BenC)

Added Branch and Tag actions  (BenC)

Web log implemented - directly launch your browser into
CVSWeb or ViewCVS on a particular file or directory.  If
your server doesn't have either of these excellent programs
installed, you can do a vanilla textual log.  (Francis)
(BenC)

Separated into an executable and a dll so you can now
perform multiple CVS operations at once.  Should improve
stability as GTK is no longer in Explorer's process space,
and is not loaded in DllMain  (Francis)

Default to quiet mode (CVS parameter "-q") to reduce the
noise in the progress display   (Francis)

Certain menu items are now on a submenu.  This is a general
ability that could be a configuration option later.

In particular, "CVS Remove" is now on the sub menu, to
reduce the chance of people accidentally selecting it
(Francis)

Automatically close progress dialog when there is no error.
I suspect that some will love this and some will hate it.
It should be a configuration option eventually (Francis)

TortoiseTip feature added.  Only one tip so far.  Basically
this adds text to help explain obscure or out of context CVS
command line messages in the progress dialog (Francis)


Changes for 0.31 (released 25 August 2000):
-------------------------------------------

Improved speed of directory display (with some caching).


Changes for 0.3 (released 4 August 2000):
-----------------------------------------

New password dialog.  It automatically appears and prompts
you for your password if a CVS operation fails because you
need to login.  This solves lots of problems with missing
.cvspass files or changed passwords.

Text/Binary file dialog.  If TortoiseCVS can't identify if a
file is text or binary, then it prompts you to tell it.

Aesthetic improvements to the main progress dialog.

New version 2000-07-22 of GTK/GDK/GLIB.
